## [How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

- In an interview, the most severe problem a programmer can make is improper use of time.
  - You must resist the urge to start coding right away, take time to understand the problem first.
- Also, keep it simple. **Don't try to over solve the problem.**

### Steps to solve the any algorithm type problem:
    
- #### 1. Read the problem completely twice.
  - Most important step.
  - Make sure you completely understand the problem. 

- #### 2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
  - Not in code, but how would you describe **generally** how to solve the problem?

- #### 3. Optimize the manual steps.
  - Find the pattern, or set of rules that will give us the solution regardless of our sample data.
  - It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.

- #### 4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  - Write out the steps lined out in 1 - 3.
  - Outline the structure of the code we will write to solve the problem.

- #### 5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  - If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.
  - It should be easy. If you struggle it is because you didn't break the problem down into small enough steps, or you don't understand the language well enough.
    - *Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:*

            - Create a list
            - Sort a list or array
            - Create a map or dictionary
            - Loop through a list, or dictionary
            - Parse strings
            - Convert from string to int, int to string, etc.

- #### 6. Optimize the real code.
  - make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names. 

- #### **As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.**

## [How to Think Like a Programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

> *“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.”* — Steve Jobs

- To "think like a programmer" is all about thinking in a more effective way for problem solving.
- **Problem solving is the meta-skill.**
- Often times, problem solving looks like this:
  - try, fail, try something else, repeat until solved.
- “Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first." -Hacker Rank

### The best way to solve problems involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

> *“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.”* — V. Anton Spraul

### **Steps to take when you encounter a problem:**

  - 1. Understand
  - 2. Plan
  - 3. Divide

####  - 1. **Understand:**
> *“If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.”* — Richard Feynman
- When you understand a problem, you can explain it in plain English.

#### 2. **Plan:**
> “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
- Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
- Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

#### 3. **Divide:**
- This is the most important step of all.
- Do not try to solve one big problem. *Instead, break it into sub-problems.*
  - Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Beginning with the simplest. 
  - Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
  - Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.

#### **Stuck**
- debug
- reassess

#### **Practice**
- If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

## [The 5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

### Origins of the 5 Whys Technique
- Sakichi Toyoda, the Japanese industrialist, inventor, and founder of Toyota Industries, developed the 5 Whys technique in the 1930s. 
- when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

>The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

### When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis
- You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
- It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem. 

### How to Use the 5 Whys

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
  - For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. Know When to Stop
   - You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. 
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures

### Appreciation
- Starting with a fact, you first ask the question, "So what?" – in other words, what are the implications of that fact? Why is this fact important?
- You then continue asking that question until you've drawn all possible conclusions from it.

- *If you let it, your world and the people around you will take all your time. Your time is not unlike your paycheck; if you don’t budget for things, you’ll have nothing left over by the end of the month.*
> “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” -Tim Ferriss
> “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.” - Cal Newport
- Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.
- **Cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.**
- If you don’t manage your time, it will manage you.
>“When you have less time available for work, you have to make better choices about what to work on (and what not to).” -Tim Metz
### You teach people how to treat you.
- **If you let people know your time is free and low-valued, people will treat it as such.**
- **If you teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, then people will respond in kind.**
### You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them!
> “The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet
- **Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities.**
- *Frankly, most people prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.*
