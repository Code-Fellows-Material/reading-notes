## REVIEW, RESEARCH, DISCUSSION

1. **When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?**

    - "**Basic** authentication transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password."

      - **Note:** For basic authentication, as the user ID and password are passed over the network as clear text (it is base64 encoded, but base64 is a reversible encoding), the basic authentication scheme is not secure. HTTPS / TLS should be used in conjunction with basic authentication.

    - **Bearer** authentication (also called token authentication) has security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

      **- Note:** Similarly to Basic authentication, Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).

2. **What does the JSON Web Token package do?**
   - "JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. The JWT package allows you to decode, verify and generate JWT."

  - RESOURCES: [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/)


3. **What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**
   - If anyone finds out our SECRET, it compromises the security of our entire system.

## Vocabulary Terms

  - **encryption**: 
      - Encryption is a way to conceal information by altering it so that it appears to be random data. Encryption is essential for security on the Internet.
  - **token**:
      - The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. 
  - **bearer**:
      -  The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” 
  - **secret**:
      - JWT is created with a secret key and that secret key is private to you which means you will never reveal that to the public or inject inside the JWT token. When you receive a JWT from the client, you can verify that JWT with this that secret key stored on the server.
  - **JSON Web Token**:
      - JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.
