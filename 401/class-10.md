# 401 - Class 10 Reading Notes

## REVIEW, RESEARCH, DISCUSSION

1. Why is access control important? 
   - It allows you to create and enforce advanced access by assigning a set of permissions. 

2. Describe an application that would need access control.
   - Any application with sensitive data, certainly, but any application with read/write capabilities, or users, I imagine you would want at least some form of access control. 
   
3. What is a role used for?
   - To define who has access to, and can do, what.

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
   - Because regardless of how many users you have there are only a specific set of roles anyone interacting with the system can have.
