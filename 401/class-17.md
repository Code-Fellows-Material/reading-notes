## REVIEW, RESEARCH, DISCUSSION

1. Describe “The Cloud”
  - "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
  - See Video:
  - https://youtu.be/FWpnbGnzk08

3. What is auto-scaling?
  - "AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance"
  - [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)

4. What is bandwidth?
  - "Bandwidth is the capacity of data that can be transferred between the site, its users and the servers. It is the capacity of the connection between the website user and the server. Bandwidths are either expressed in MB/s (Megabytes per Second) or GB/s (Gigabytes per Second). "

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  - Through a variety of factors such as networking costs, computer costs, storage, and maintenance costs.

## Vocabulary Terms

- Server Instances:
  -  "A cloud instance is a virtual server instance in a cloud computing environment. It is built, hosted and delivered using a cloud computing platform, and can be accessed remotely. A cloud computing platform is a shared pool of compute resources and services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal efforts. For the most part, a cloud instance works the same way as physical servers. Dedicated compute resources are reserved for each cloud instance. Because the instance is virtualized it is hardware independent and can be easily moved from one hardware node to another. Instances therefore, share the resources of several hardware nodes making it easy to scale, more flexible, and more cost-efficient than other solutions. Cloud instances are also known as cloud servers, virtual servers, virtual machines etc."

- Cloud Services:
  - Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. 

- Cloud Architecture:
  - "Cloud architecture is how individual technologies are integrated to create clouds—IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. Cloud architecture is how all the components and capabilities necessary to build a cloud are connected in order to deliver an online platform on which applications can run."
  - [Link](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-cloud-architecture)

- AWS:
  - "AWS is made up of many different cloud computing products and services. The highly profitable division of Amazon provides servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security. AWS can be broken into three main products: EC2, Amazon’s virtual machine service, Glacier, a low-cost cloud storage service, and S3, Amazon’s storage system."

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:
  - " The 30-thousand-foot comparison of these, Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, solutions (production configurations) is that they have comparable features and pricing. One big difference is that Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve."
  - [Heroku v.s. AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7)
